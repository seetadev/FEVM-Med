Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal powered by Embark, IPFS, FEVM and Filecoin eco-system tools. We provide secure data storage & transparency of medical counseling report data using decentralized data storage powered by Filecoin, Orthanc PACS (picture archiving and communication system) using NFT.storage, FEVM and Chainlink VRF. Our service aims at providing secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

Our decentralized chat application enables medical counselling in a privacy preserved chat like interface powered by IPFS and Filecoin using FEVM and Chainlink VRF.

# Features:

Data Transparency : Availability of patientâ€™s medical counseling records across different stakeholder through secure Ethereum blockchain network. The platform utilizes Ethereum and Filecoin blockchain, IPFS/Filecoin via NFT.Storage and FEVM, Nucypher i.e. patients and organizations who place their data on the exchange will be able to control which consortium entities have permission to access information.

Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. Also records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over course of time.

Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs helps in improved care coordination. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction of diseases.

# Implementation

We have developed the decentralized medical counseling application using Ethereum and Filecoin Blockchain powered by FEVM, IPFS, Embark, Chainlink, node.js framework, nvm, javascript frameworks. We are using HTML5 technologies and JavaScript framework for developing the frontend of the application.

FEVM: FEVM enables us to use composable and stackable building blocks and primitives exposed through standardized interfaces, enabling the construction of interconnected picture archiving and medical imaging (PACS) solutions, thereby improving better outcomes for medical counseling, preventive treatment and early stage detection of diseases. Research labs, institutions in medical imaging could also could harvest tokens in a DAO-driven decentralize compute fabric by analyzing radiology datasets in X Rays, MRI and CT Scan, performing scientific and ML modelling using PyTorch and OpenCV, calculate statistics and share early stage medical abnormalities, improving coordinated care and precision medicine.

Chainlink: We utilized Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to enable provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) for a queuing counselling ticket that further enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

At this juncture, we are planning to use only subscription supported network for Chainlink VRF. We are also connecting offchain data from medical counseling app to our smart contracts using Chainlink.

PyDICOM: We are using PyDICOM for anonymizing and encrypting medical data. This data is then served to the counseling application via open source Orthanc PACS.
